# FeelHome
Welcome to FeelHome, your real estate management platform. This project is designed to help agencies efficiently manage properties, agents, bookings, and client interactions using a streamlined web interface.

By default, this project includes a Django backend, basic frontend templates, and a SQLite database to get you up and running quickly. You are encouraged to customize and expand the features to meet your agencyâ€™s specific needs.

To get started, explore the project directory, review the Django settings, and begin working in your preferred development environment. This setup is fully local and does not affect any production environment.
